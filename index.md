## About Me

  As a computer science student for the last three years, I recognize the importance of understanding certain key principles to prepare myself for a future career in software engineering. Among these principles, collaborating with others, object oriented programming, secure programming, and software testing consistently stood out as the most important concepts to master. I found myself honing these skills in every project during my time at SNHU and used the feedback from my professors to ensure I continued to grow throughout the program.
  
  SNHU's computer science program emphasized collaborative work and how to communicate computer science concepts to stakeholders and other team members. Regardless of the industry, collaboration and communication are key interpersonal skills to possess. Our weekly discussion posts has helped prepare me for communicating technical concepts with others. It has allowed me to learn from how others communicate as well, helping to improve my own communication. I also has the pleasure of participating in multiple collaborative projects that taught me how to work with others using Git version control software.
  
  Early in the program I took a great interest in web applications because of their power and versatility. They're also a lot of fun to make! In addition to my class projects, I put these skills to the test by writing my own web applications that varied in complexity. My most recent web application, a social recipe-sharing platform, is a culmination of everything I have learned and really tested my skills. The complexity speaks to my design skills and my ability to develop robust database schemas. It is for this reason that I chose to highlight a handful of my skills in this e-portfolio with this project.
  
  Among the most important classes I took at SNHU, data structures and algorithms still stands out in my mind as essential. While I likely won't be writing algorithms on daily basis, understanding the mechanics behind the most frequently used data structures and algorithms is what will allow me to successfully work with others in established codebases and, when the time comes, maybe even help develop a codebase myself. I find binary search trees to be flexible and applicable in many different situations which is why I chose to highlight my binary search tree project in this e-portfolio.
