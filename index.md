## About Me

  As a computer science student for the last three years, I recognize the importance of understanding certain key principles to prepare myself for a future career in software engineering. Among these principles, object oriented programming, secure programming, and software testing consistently stood out as the most important concepts to master. I found myself honing these skills in every project during my time at SNHU and used the feedback from my professors to ensure I continued to grow throughout the program.
  
  Early in the program I took a great interest in web applications because of their power and versatility. They're also a lot of fun to make! In addition to my class projects, I put these skills to the test by writing my own web applications that varied in complexity. My most recent web application, a social recipe-sharing platform, is a culmination of everything I have learned and really tested my skills. The complexity speaks to my design skills and my ability to develop robust database schemas. It is for this reason that I chose to highlight a handful of my skills in this e-portfolio with this project.
